Create a branch with the name of your board that you are working on and start working on that.If two people are woking on same board, add your name at the end seperated with a "-". Don't push any incomplete work to master, keep it clean.

Once you are done designing everthing, add the gerber files in a seperate zip file, merge your branch to master and delete the branch.
